App Idea:
- Event and Profile management App for my cricket club. The app should enable all functionalities that the web app has like user profiles, event creation, rsvp, access based on user role, etc. This will make it easier for users to read up on announcements, news, rsvp for any scheduled games, or let the admins create events that players can sign up for, keep track of scorecards and leagues. These should be the basic functionalities of the apps.
